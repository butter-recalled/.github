# 📖 Plot Overview

Sure! Here's a **plot overview** of **_Sacramento (2025)_**, the upcoming road trip comedy starring **Michael Angarano** and **Michael Cera**:

### 🚗 **Plot Overview:**

*Sacramento* follows **Rickey** (Michael Angarano), a free-spirited, spontaneous, and slightly chaotic guy who convinces his more grounded and cautious childhood friend **Glenn** (Michael Cera) to go on an impulsive road trip from **Los Angeles to Sacramento**.

The road trip begins as a quirky escape from their daily lives, but as the journey unfolds, the two friends are forced to confront their diverging paths, personal regrets, and the complexities of adulthood. With unexpected detours—both literal and emotional—the trip becomes a vehicle (pun intended) for **self-discovery**, **reconciliation**, and **genuine male vulnerability**.

Along the way, they encounter:
- **Rosie** (Kristen Stewart), Glenn’s pregnant wife, who adds emotional stakes and tension to Glenn’s decision to leave town.
- **Tallie** (Maya Erskine), a character who plays a key role in shaking up Rickey’s worldview.

### 🎭 **Tone & Style:**
Think **indie dramedy with heart**, blending **awkward humor, emotional depth**, and **character-driven storytelling**. It’s about friendship, growing up (even when you thought you already had), and that bittersweet line between who you were and who you're becoming.

If you liked films like *The End of the Tour*, *Little Miss Sunshine*, or *Mid90s*, this one might hit your sweet spot.
